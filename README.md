README
======

This is a git repository containing the python code which wraps the TRANSPHERE project.
It does *not* contain the source code for TRANSPHERE.

This has been curated by Tom Rice (t.rice90@gmail.com), who did not write any of the code.
It includes python examples which are being circulated in Jes K. Jorgensen's research group in Copenhagen.

TRANSPHERE was written by C. P. Dullemond; it can be found here:
http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/transphere/index.shtml
and its method is described in detail in the paper by
Dullemond, van Zadelhoff & Natta (2003) http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...389..464D
.

Note:

  The program TRANSPHERE is written in fortran 77. An example setup
  is created by a program written in the IDL programming language
  (see www.rsinc.com). Also the example read and plot routines for
  the output are written in IDL. IDL is licenced software, and can
